## Core UI Guidelines

1. **Consistent Design Language**

   - Text: #212121 (dark gray)
   - Completed tasks: #9e9e9e (gray, with strikethrough)

4. **Button Styles**
   - Use contained buttons for primary actions (e.g., Add Task, Save).
   - Use outlined buttons for secondary actions (e.g., Cancel, Edit).
   - Buttons should have a minimum touch target of 48x48px.

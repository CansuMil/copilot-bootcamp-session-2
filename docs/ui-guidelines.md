### Theming and Visuals
- Use frosted glass effects and subtle snowflake or winter sport iconography in backgrounds and cards.
- Add Olympic-inspired icons (medals, snowflakes, sports equipment) for actions and status.
- Consider a header or splash screen with the 2026 Winter Olympics logo and host city.

### Typography
- Use modern, clean fonts similar to Olympic branding (e.g., Montserrat, Roboto).

### Component Customization
- Style Material UI components with the above palette and frosted glass backgrounds.
- Use themed icons for actions (e.g., medal for completed tasks).

### Accessibility and Responsiveness
- Ensure all themed visuals maintain accessibility and work on all devices.

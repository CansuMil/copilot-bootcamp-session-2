# Coding Guidelines for TODO App

This document outlines the coding standards and quality principles for the TODO application project.

## General Formatting Rules
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript).
- Limit lines to 100 characters where possible.
- Use semicolons consistently at the end of statements.
- Prefer single quotes for strings, except when escaping is easier with double quotes.
- Add meaningful comments where necessary, but avoid redundant comments.

## Import Organization
- Group imports by external libraries first, then internal modules.
- Use absolute imports for modules when possible.
- Remove unused imports and variables.
- Keep import statements at the top of the file.

## Linter Usage
- Use ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting.
- Fix all linter errors and warnings before committing code.
- Use Prettier for automatic code formatting.

## Best Practices
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: avoid code duplication.
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Write small, focused functions and components.
- Prefer const and let over var for variable declarations.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Refactor code regularly to improve readability and maintainability.

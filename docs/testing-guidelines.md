# Testing Guidelines for TODO App

This document outlines the core testing principles and guidelines for the TODO application.

## Core Testing Principles

1. **Unit Testing**
   - All core logic and components should have unit tests.
   - Use Jest as the primary testing framework for both frontend and backend.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the interaction between multiple components or modules.
   - Ensure API endpoints and data flows are covered by integration tests.

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
   - Simulate real user scenarios to verify the app works as expected from the user's perspective.
   - Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Strive for high test coverage, especially for critical features.
   - All new features must include appropriate tests before merging.

5. **Maintainability**
   - Write clear, descriptive, and maintainable tests.
   - Refactor tests as the codebase evolves to avoid brittle or outdated tests.

6. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run all tests automatically in the CI pipeline before deployment.

7. **Test Data and Isolation**
   - Use mock data and isolate tests to avoid dependencies and side effects.
